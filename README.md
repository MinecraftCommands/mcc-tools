# MCC Gadgets

Here you will find various tools, some to help with data/resource pack development, and some to improve the experience of the community. The website can be found here: <https://www.mcc-gadgets.com/>

The project is fully open source, feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes or new features.

The site is hosted on Vercel, meaning we can have proper server side logic, the site isn't purely static. So APIs and dynamically generated content are within the scope of the site. However, it is a serverless architecture, so the server isn't intended for long running calculations or for automatically polling other data source.

I don't currently have a good list of all the planned features, but I will try to write something up at some point
